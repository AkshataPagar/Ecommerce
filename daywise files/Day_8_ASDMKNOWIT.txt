

	Day 8:
		
Introduction Cloud

	 Cloud
		: A virtual Enviornment

			 for deploying applications, services
			 on  platform
				security, scalability, availablity
			 
			on  infrastructure
				Computing resources
	
				( processing power (CPU + GPU) +  RAM )

				Storage resources
				 (Elastic Storage high speed, durable, recoverable)

				High speed Network for applications
				   


	 Google Drive:
			    Cloud storage Service-- is based on Pay as you Go model
			
			   Service ?
				 some kind of logic/ functionality/  Feature
				 a kind request received and 
				 request processed 
					Response  is sent back to
	  
	Collaborative online Serives:
			Google Suite, Microsoft 365
	
	 Service : 

		Google Suite
			Google Drive, Gmail, Doc, Spreasheet, form, hangout, GMeet, 
			One Drive,

	 Consumer: can be enduser, can be some application.
	 Consumer needs internet connection, a device and authorize Access
		  needs subscription( Secure , Authorized Access to  application or 						content)

		  can access application, data at any time
		  can access  application , data using any device
		  can access applications , data from any where
		
					
	 Service Provider: Google, Microsoft
			storage facility--- using plan 
					any data, any size data,									       any type of,
			
			sharing facility--- capability
					   of controlled access

		Everything is managed by service Provider
	
		Everything= service hosting + service execution+ Enviornment (Physical Infra)


	 Google data Center
	 What is Data Center?

		 continous infrastructure
		 always services avaialble
		 High level security
		 Weather, Fire , Earthquage infrastructure facility
		 High cooling system for keeping Computational enviornment running
			
	
	ROI : return On investment
		Ravi spending 40 lakh rupees for initial investment to build his own
				Computing facility for applications consumed by 
				Students
		it is not proper for such huge initial investment
	
	Option for Ravi Tambade to use  Cloud as Platform and
			Deploy applications to cloud in short time duration


	 Go to cloud
		 and how are you going to use Cloud
			consumer------ access services
		hosting you apps-------access platform
		host my servers,apps,even mangage-----access Infrastructure


		1.Choose you vendor  	: Google, Microsoft, Amazon
		
		2.subscribe to vendor cloud:  GCP, Azure, AWS 

		3.Access Cloud console :
					 start using Cloud 
						as  IAAS
						as  PAAS
		after subscribing to  Google
				being as end user 

					start consuming services giveny by vendor
					 SAAS

					Google Drive,
					Google Earth,
					Gmail

	Node JS-------?
		
		node js is a runtime
		you write a simple javascript program without browser exeuction
		you can perform file IO operations using Node JS
		In node js , we can use callback function
		
		Hello World Node js application
		
		Node js:
			for more traffice 
			Less computation
			Asynchrnous Programming
			Event Driven
			Create server program
		Which tool are you using to write Node JS application
			 Visual Code
			
		
			create index.html file
			create server.js file
			run server.js which will host index.html
			

	
		Runtime:
						Execution Engine
		php ---------xamp Apache-------php interpreter---------------------
		jsp----------tomcat server------jvm (Java Virtual Machine)-----------400 MB 
		asp.net------IIS----------------CLR (Execution Engine)--------------- 800 MB
		Exress,http---can create your own server--Node JS---------------------19 MB
				server.js
		MEAN Stack:
				

	.Introduction Virtualization
	
		
		at a time only one operating System will controlling your hardware
		We can install multipl operating systems on one computer 
			but we can run only one OS at a time.

		Ravi:
			16 GB RAM
			i7 Core Processor
			1 TB Harddisk

		Virtualization:
						
			
			we will have one physical machine
				where host OS will be windows
			we have create one virtual machine 
				where guest OS for VM will be Linux
			you need virtualization Enables at hardware level in BIOS Setting
			
			you need Virtualization Software to create virtual machine on your computer

				Virtual Box-----------Oracle------------------linux 
				VMware workstation-----Vmware
				Microsft Hypervisor-----Microsft























	.Overview of Containersation
	.Cloud Computing
		IAAS, PAAS, SAAS


	Day9:

	Introduction to AWS
	Exploring AWS
	Creating VM in  AWS

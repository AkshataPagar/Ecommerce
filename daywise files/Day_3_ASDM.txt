Introduction

Purpose:
	The Online Shopping System for products shop web appliction is inteneded to provide complete solutions for vendors as well as customers through a single get way using the internet. It will enable vendors to setup onlineshops, customer to browse through the shop and purchase them online without having to visiting the shop physically.

Scope:
	This system allows the customer's to maintain their product for add or remove the product over the internet.
	Shoppers will be able to manage thier products stock.

Definitions:
	   OSS --> 	Online Shopping System
	   SRS --> 	Software Requirement Specification
	   GUI---> 	Graphical User Interface
	   Portal-->    Personalized Website
	   Stackholder--> The person who will participate in the System. And Onwer of system
				Ex.  Customer, Adminstrator , Shopper
	   UML--->	Software Engineering Notation for visualising System in the form diagrams
 	   SSL--->	Secure Socket Layer used for providing restricted access to application.
	   BOD--->      Board Of Directors (Management)
		

Overview:
	This System provides an easy to solution customer's to buy the product withouy going to the shop and also shop owner to sale         their product.

Additional Information:
	The system work on internet server, so it will  be operated by any end user user for the buying purpose.

	
General Description:
	The Online shopping application helps to manage the items in the shoppers and also helps customers to purchase.
	The online shopping system will use the internet as the sole method for selling goods to its consumers.
	
	
Functional Requirement:
	This section provides requirement overview of the system. Various functional modules that can be implemented by 
	the system will be-
	
	Description:
	Registration if customer wants to buy the product then he/she must be registered, Unregistered user can not get to shopping 		cart.
        Login Customer logins to the system by entering valid user id and password for shopping.
	End User can Browse Prodcts , their categories as well, he/ she can add products to her/his wishlist.
	Payment for customer; there are many of secure billing will be prepaid as debit or credit cart ,
								      postpaid as after shipping ,check or bank draft.
	
	Logout after the payment of the product the customer will logged out.
	Report Generation after all transation the system can generate the portable file (.pdf)
	then sent one copy to customer's Email- address and 
        another one for the system database to calculate the monthly transaction.
        

Technical Issues:
	This system will work on client-Server architecture. It will require an internet server.
	The system should support some commonly used browser such as any  Chrome etc.
	Interface Requirement Various interfaces for the product could be 
	1.Login Page, 
	2.Registration form
	
	There will be a screen displaying information about product that the shop having.

	If the customers select the buy button then another screen of shopping cart will be opened.
		1.Login Page
		2.Registration Form
		3.Product Page
		4.Shopping Cart
	
 Hardware Interface:
	The System must run over the internet,
        all the hardware shall require to connect internet will be hardware interface for the system.
		e.g. modem,  WAN, LAN
		Specialized Server Infrastructure Hardware
		
 Software Interface:
	The system is on server so it requires the any scripting language like JSP or  PHP or ASP, ETC.
	The system require DataBase also for the store the any transaction of the system like MySql or oracle, or SQL server etc.
	System also require DNS (Domain Name space) for the naming on the internet.
	http://www.transflower.in
	http://www.amazon.in
        At the lat user need web browser for interact with the system.


Performance Requirement:
	There is no  performance requirement in this system, because the server request  and respone to client is totally based on internet 	connection of enduser.

Design Constrains:
	This system should be developed using  Standard Web Page Development Tool , which conforms GUI standards such like HTML, XML, JSON,etc.



Non-Functional Requirements

1.Security:
	  SSL
	The System use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) in all trancations that include any confidential customer information.
	The system must automcatically log out all customers after a period of inactivity.
	The system should not leave any cookies on the customer's computer containing users's password.
	The system's back-end servers shall  only be accessible to authenticated administrators.
	Sensitive data will be encrypted  before being sent onver insecure connections like internet.
	  


2.Reliability:
	The system provides storage of all databases on redundant computers with  automatic switchover. 
	The main pillar of reliability of the system  is the backup of the database 
	which is conitinously maintained and update to reflect  the most recenet changes.


3: Availability:
	The system should be available at all times.meaning the user can access it using web browser, 
        only restricted by the down time of the server on which the system runs.
        In case of a of a hardware failure or database corruption, a replacement page will be shown. 
	uptime : It mean 24 * 7 availability
	100%--------------
	99.9%
	99.999%
	99.9999%


4: Maintainability:
	A commercial database is used for maintaining the databae and application server takes care of the site. 
	The maintainability can be done efficiently.

5.Portability:
	The application is HTML and scripting language based (Javascript). So the end user part is fully portable and any system using any web         browser should be able to use the features of the system,including any hardware platform that is available 
	or will be available in the futuer. 
	An end-user  is used this system on an OS;either it is Windows or Linux.
	The System shall run on PC, Laptops and PDA.etc.

Operational Scenario:
	Customer Interaction

	The Customer want to buy item. The system shows all product categories to customer. If custoemr select item then  those items are listed in shoppingcart for buying. The payment will be made with credit card or debit card. If customer wants to cancel the order before shopping then he or she can cancel it. Customer can see the buying report on account details. Customer will receve email about purchase done.

	Shopper Interaction:
	
	Staff Interaction:
	
	BOD (Board Of Directors)
	
	


Preliminary Schedule: :

	
	1.Login
	2,.Manage customer database Browse category
	3.add or remove item from cart
	4. Manage customer database
	5.update item category
	6.approve/reject shop creation

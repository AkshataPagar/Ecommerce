
Day 5:
	Agenda:
		
		1.Design
			:
			 identify Business Entities, operations, rules, contraints, policies
			 visualize all in diagrams.

			 
		2.Object Oriented Approach:

			Online Shopping Application
				real life entities (Objects)
				class diagrams (Notation)
				modularity model(Reusibility)
				into small part devide Solution
				Abstracting Functional and Non Functional Requirement of System
				small small part gather together to achive objective (Cohesion)
				Hiding unnecessary Details

			"Natural Way of thinking"
			
				1.Identify object------> actors, entities

					Web Application,Users, end user,Adminstrator, Director,
					retailor,
					Customer,Vendor,Shopper,ShoppingCart,Product,Price
					Order,Account,Item,Consumers
					Credential
					Category,Payment, Creditcard, Debit Card, Cash
					Report (pdf file), Email,database
					internet server,
					Transation,
					Review,
					Rating,
					Bill,
					Service Provider
					promotions,
					Parcel,

					Offers


				2.Use cases : Scenario

					    1.Payment Processing
					    2.Order Processing
					    3.Tracking
					    4.Membership & Roles Management
					    5.productcatalog
					    6.Personalization
					    7.Shipping (Delivery management)
					    8.CustomerRelationShip Management( CRM)
					    9.ShoppingCart
					    10.BI (Business Intelligence)


			        3.Identify relations between Entities (Objects)

					EndUer-- Customer
					Product---price
					Product---Item----ShopptingCart
						---Item---Order
					Product--review---Rating
					Order---Bill----payment
					Customer----Credential
					EndUser---Review, Rating
					
					Payment----Account------Transaction
					Payment--CreditCard
					Payment--DebitCard
					Payment--CashonDelivery
					Customer---Email----report---pdf file
					billl ----- report
					Bill---Parcel
					Product---Item---ShoppingCart----Order-----Bill----payment----Parcel
					Product---Offer
					Product--- Offer---Vendor---Promotion
				


				4.Classify Objects
				
				        Classification:
					
					Clustering:

					         User, Customer, retailor, Director, Administrator, Shopper, Vendor, Service Provider
						 Product, category, Item, Shopping Cart,
					         Order, Bill , Payment,
						 Payment, CreditCard, DebitCard, CashOnDelivery.....

							
					Classification will help in identifying common characteristic between diff objects
								                common behaviours between objects
										common state between objects

				5.Define Roles and Resposibilities for Objects
					EndUser:
						can visit web site
						can browse products available
						can add selected product in to wish list
					        can add likes, comments, review, recommendations to the Product
						can add get details of Product
						can add selected product items to Shopping Cart
						can update items from shopping Cart
						can empty Shopping Cart
						can checkout for placing order.
					Customer:
						can place order
						can cancel order before shipping
						can change his personal information needed for Account processing
						can provide payment details for payment processing
						can track order delivery which is placed.
						can view Order placed history.
					Product:
					Category:
					Item:
					Shopping Cart
					Order:
					Payment
					Credential:
					Bill
					Adminstrator:
					BOD:



		Object Oriented Approach: Natural way of Thinking

		
				Abstraction:
				
						Getting an essential characteristic of a system, 
						depending on perspective of an Observer.
			

				Each software is inherently complex system to be  understood  for  an enduser



				Encapsulation:
						Hiding complexity of system by providing simplified wrapper 
						(User friendly Interface)
		
						Use Case Diagram----------- UML 

						      
				Inheritance:



	OOD:
		Object Oriented Design
					UML 
						 UML diagrams 
							
			 				Use Case Diagrams, 
							Sequence  Diagrams, 
							Class  Diagrams, 
							Activity Diagrams
							State transtion Diagrams
			 				Deployment Diagrams
				



		3.Loose Coupling, Cohesion
		4.Object Oriented Analysis & Design
		5.Notations to be followed
			 UML (Unified Modeling Language)

		Take a way:
		
		

		 OOD principles
			Major Pillars as well as minor pillars of OO 
				 for online shopping application

		 Come up with proper deployment scenario for Online shopping




				Major Pillars of OO
